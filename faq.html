	<div class="box1">“Heady” glass refers to the craftwork of master glass blowers and artisans, where aesthetic and artistic skill are emphasized over pure functionality to demonstrate the combination of technical talent and human imagination. Glassmaking is an extremely brutal art to master, requiring decades of constant hard work and practice to achieve a level of  mastery required to be considered capable of creating “Heady” glass. The equipment and materials used are very expensive. Advanced glassblowing techniques are used to create visually appealing effects. Considered a step above “Scientific” glass, which focuses on minimal toxins in glassblowing artists, “Heady” glass combines elements of lower-tier glass blowing art to create the highest level of visual aesthetic with combined peak functionality. These art pieces are made in very limited quantities with expensive materials, creating a massive market for them amongst enthusiasts.

	Certain kinds of glass sculptures are used for spiritual crystal meditation. The piece is surrounded by crystals, and the quartz nail is heated for a specific time based on its size. Once the ‘ideal’ heating has been reached, there is a short period until it cools down from it’s “chaotic peak”  to the “start point” before it begins to lower to the “baseline”. The process starts by inducing the “chaotic peak” followed by preparation for the “start point” with breathing in deeply, afterwards the individual closes their eyes and holds their breath in until “baseline” is reaching. The surrounded crystals channel the energy of the heat to provide spiritual guidance and healing. Once “baseline” is reached, the individual will open their eyes and breath in deeply, ending the meditation. There’s a large amount of variety amongst enthusiasts in regards to the kinds of crystals that are used to bring upon different kinds of energy, as well as the level of spiritual ability available in the glass. Different kinds of glass sculptures carry largely contrasting energy. For example, some would be specifically used for dealing with grief or loss while others would be specifically used for introspective thought and reflecting on past experiences. The same goes for crystals. Certain sculptures pair with certain crystals for a combined effect. Trades are the most common transaction within the market as all enthusiasts value the pursuit of a vast collection in order to have the ability for expanded forms of meditation. This style of meditation is commonly practiced amongst individuals with interests in astrology and witchcraft.

	The practice of correctly using the glass is about as serious as the glass blowing process that creates it in the first place. This timer application is aimed to produce the best possible experience when utilizing the glass sculptures by having popular and custom setting options, expressing the aesthetic of “Heady” glass, and ensuring the best care for maximum longevity of glass. It is made to withstand heat and cool down with proper care involved to not scar or scorch the glass. Incorrect or repeated usage will lead to damage and loss of quality and value.
